    "feedback": "The job posting is relatively clear but contains several errors and inconsistencies (\"Harware,\" capitalization inconsistencies, repetitive sections). These mistakes negatively affect readability and professionalism. Consider revising for clearer formatting, proofreading spelling, and removing repeated content. \n\nRegarding inclusivity, the posting lacks explicit language to indicate equal opportunity employment or commitment to diversity and inclusion. Adding statements that encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds and explicitly stating an equal opportunity employment policy would improve inclusivity.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the requirements provided appear relevant and reasonable, clearly connected to the role. However, the posting could benefit from clarifying salary or compensation details beyond \"Depends on Experience,\" as transparency in compensation promotes fairness.\n\nOverall, improving proofreading, explicitly addressing inclusivity, and clarifying compensation information would significantly enhance this job posting.",
