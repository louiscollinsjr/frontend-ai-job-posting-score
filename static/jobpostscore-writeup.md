# JobPostScore: Every posting should reach the right candidate

With AI-powered analysis, JobPostScore helps talent teams turn job postings into optimized discovery engines—applying the same structured data standards that power Google Jobs, LinkedIn, and every major hiring platform.

## The hidden cost of unclear job postings

Hiring isn't just about finding talent. It's about being found.

"When you post a job, you're competing with millions of other listings," says [Your Name/Title]. "If your posting doesn't match how candidates search, or how algorithms scan, you're invisible. And invisibility is expensive."

The challenge isn't new, but expectations have changed. Modern candidates expect clarity—precise role descriptions, transparent compensation, and posts that actually show up when they search. Meanwhile, hiring platforms and AI-powered job aggregators demand structured data, specific formatting, and schema compliance just to surface your listing.

For talent acquisition teams managing dozens of openings across departments, maintaining that quality consistently is nearly impossible. A developer role might score high on technical clarity but miss location keywords. A leadership post might have perfect structure but lack salary transparency required by state law. And without visibility into *why* applications are low, teams keep posting—and waiting.

"You can have the best role in the world," says [TA Leader Name]. "But if the posting doesn't meet the standards that hiring platforms require, candidates never see it."

## Scoring what matters: visibility, clarity, compliance

JobPostScore was built to solve exactly that gap. Using AI-powered analysis and schema validation, the platform evaluates every job posting against the seven dimensions that determine whether it gets seen, understood, and clicked:

- **Clarity & Readability**: Is the role immediately understandable, or buried in buzzwords?
- **Search Alignment**: Does it match how candidates actually search for jobs?
- **Structured Data**: Is it machine-readable for Google Jobs and aggregators?
- **Recency & Freshness**: How long has it been live? Are urgency signals present?
- **Keyword Targeting**: Are the right role, level, location, and skill terms included?
- **Compensation Transparency**: Is salary disclosed per compliance requirements?
- **Page Context**: Is the content clean, organized, and focused?

The result is a 100-point score with category-level diagnostics—showing teams exactly where each posting falls short and how to fix it.

"We didn't want another checkbox tool," says [Your Name]. "We wanted something that explains *why* a posting isn't working and gives you the insights to improve it immediately."

## From audit to optimization in minutes

JobPostScore works in three steps:

**Analyze**: Teams paste a job URL or raw text. The platform parses structure, extracts keywords, and validates schema compliance—the same way hiring platforms scan content.

**Diagnose**: Within seconds, the system returns a detailed scorecard with category breakdowns, flagged issues, and specific improvement recommendations powered by OpenAI.

**Optimize**: Teams can export findings, track version changes, and re-score optimized drafts to measure improvement over time.

Behind the scenes, JobPostScore combines deterministic metrics—sentence length, keyword presence, structured data validation—with LLM-based assessments of readability and search alignment. It's a hybrid approach designed to be both consistent and contextually aware.

"It's not just about getting a score," says [TA Professional]. "It's about understanding what the score means. If my posting is missing location modality or has vague compensation language, I need to know that before we go live—not after applications dry up."

## Building confidence into every posting

Early users are seeing clear impact:

- **Faster optimization cycles**: What used to take multiple review rounds now happens in one audit
- **Higher visibility**: Posts optimized for schema and keywords show up in more aggregator feeds  
- **Compliance confidence**: Built-in checks for pay transparency and structured data requirements
- **Consistent quality**: Teams can benchmark postings across roles, departments, and hiring managers

The platform also supports guest audits, letting teams experiment with scoring before committing—making it easy for hiring managers to get quick feedback without workflow disruption.

"Every job posting is a discovery problem," says [Your Name]. "The right candidate is searching. Your job is to make sure you show up in their results. That's what we're optimizing for."

## What's next: enterprise intelligence for hiring

JobPostScore is expanding its capabilities to include version tracking, team collaboration tools, and integrations with major ATS platforms. Future releases will add industry-specific benchmarks and compliance checks tailored to geographic requirements.

"There's a massive opportunity here," says [Your Name]. "Every company is hiring. Every company is posting jobs. But very few are thinking about those postings as structured, optimized content. That's what we're changing."

For talent teams, the goal is simple: make every job posting work harder—so the right candidates see it, understand it, and apply.

"We're in the business of connecting talent with opportunity," says [Your Name]. "With the right analysis, we can do that faster and better than ever before."
